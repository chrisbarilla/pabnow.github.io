			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>The Police Accountability Board Alliance is a coalition of over 50 community organizations united to hold the police accountable in Rochester. The Alliance brings a diversity of perspectives and expertise to the shared struggle for police accountability. The City fails to hold police accountable largely because of the lack of community power over the police oversight system. The Alliance strives to change this paradigm by giving the community the power to review police misconduct and discipline officers.</p>

			<p>One major function of the Alliance is to lead the campaign for establishing a Police Accountability Board (PAB). The Alliance has used public forums and demonstrations to increase public awareness. Police accountability is popular in Rochester and it is the mission of the Alliance to mobilize people to push the PAB forward. Ultimately it is up to City Council to pass the PAB with 5 essential pillars:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>an independent agency of city government, separate from RPD, with a budget equivalent to 1% of RPD's</li>
			<li>independent investigative authority</li>
			<li>subpoena power</li>
			<li>disciplinary power through a disciplinary matrix</li>
			<li>power to assess RPD policies and procedures and make recommendations</li>
			</ul>
